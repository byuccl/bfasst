# WARNING: Both netlists must have the exact same inputs and outputs!                             #
# WARNING: The Carry mapping is only for CARRY4 instances!                                        #
# WARNING: If there is multiple counters with the same number of FFs, the mapping might be wrong! #
#          (Multiple Carry chain not yet supported)                                               #
# WARNING: Accessing the wires and pins from the S port of the CARRIES assuming                   #
#          that they go from index 0 to 3!                                                        #
# WARNING: If a LUT is connected to the carry, the algorithm will grab any FF                     #
#          connected to that LUT!                                                                 #
# WARNING: Algorithm assumes that there is only one CARRY chain in each netlist!                  #
# WARNING: When mapping the nets between carries and flipflops it is assumed that their nets      #
#          are accessed in the same order.                                                        #
