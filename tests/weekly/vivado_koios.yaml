    # - koios/bwave_like.float.large

    # - koios/dla_like.large # Overutilized DSPs, LUTs, BRAMs, and SLICEs
    # - koios/tdarknet_like.small # Needs 1600+ BRAMs
    # - koios/conv_layer_hls # Critical Warnings in synthesis
    # - koios/clstm_like.medium # too many I/Os (I ran this and almost everything got optimized out, design was basically empty, no LUTs, no SLICEs, no BRAMs, no DSPs, literally just a couple IO)
    # - koios/tdarknet_like.large # Vivado synth fails -> comb assignment to registers (fixed that, but 2826+ BRAMs required, overutilizes biggest kintex board)
