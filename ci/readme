Organization

The ci script is the meat of the process.  It first removes everything
from potentially previous runs.  Then it sets up a chroot using
debootstrap and generates a ci script to run inside it.  It then mounts
proc, sys and dev, bind-mounts vivado into the chroot, copies ssh keys
into the chroot, and execs into the generated script.

The script begins by creating a new test user and copying the ssh
keys into the new user's home directory.  It then installs some basic
prerequisites to align the chroot with a normal install of ubuntu.
It then su's into the test user and attempts to build bfasst.  Note that
the process can be configured with several variables at the top, relating
to conformal access and vivado location.

The current script determines the latest commit to the bfasst repo.

The fail script sends a message to the bfasst slack channel.  Note that
this requires a file called slack_webhook in its directory, and expects
the commit id on stdin.

The run script ties it all together. It caches the commit from a previous
run, if any, and if the new commit differs from the old commit, runs ci.
If ci exits nonzero, it runs fail with the newest commit id on stdin.
